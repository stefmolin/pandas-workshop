## Abstract

Working with data can be challenging: it often doesn’t come in the best format for analysis, and understanding it well enough to extract insights requires both time and the skills to filter, aggregate, reshape, and visualize it. This session will equip you with the knowledge you need to effectively use pandas – a powerful library for data analysis in Python – to make this process easier.

Pandas makes it possible to work with tabular data and perform all parts of the analysis from collection and manipulation through aggregation and visualization. While most of this session focuses on pandas, during our discussion of visualization, we will also introduce at a high level Matplotlib (the library that pandas uses for its visualization features, which when used directly makes it possible to create custom layouts, add annotations, etc.) and Seaborn (another plotting library, which features additional plot types and the ability to visualize long-format data).

## Session Outline

This is an introductory workshop on pandas first delivered at [ODSC Europe 2021](https://odsc.com/speakers/introduction-to-data-analysis-using-pandas/) and subsequently at the [5th Annual Toronto Machine Learning Summit](https://www.torontomachinelearning.com/events/introduction-to-data-analysis-using-pandas/) in 2021, [PyCon US 2022](https://us.pycon.org/2022/schedule/presentation/24/), [ODSC Europe 2023](https://odsc.com/speakers/introduction-to-data-analysis-using-pandas/), [PyCon CZ 2023](https://cz.pycon.org/2023/program/workshops/26/), PyCon Poland 2024, PyCon Portugal 2024, and SciPy 2025, along with abbreviated versions at [PyCon UK 2022](https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/LZKN7F/), [PyCon Portugal 2022](https://pretalx.evolutio.pt/pyconpt2022/talk/TUZZMY/), [EuroSciPy 2023](https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/PWER3Z/), [PyCon UK 2023](https://pretalx.com/pyconuk-2023/talk/YLGFCE/), PyCon MEA 2023, and PyCon France 2024. It's divided into the following sections:

### Section 1: Getting Started With Pandas
We will begin by introducing the `Series`, `DataFrame`, and `Index` classes, which are the basic building blocks of the pandas library, and showing how to work with them. By the end of this section, you will be able to create DataFrames and perform operations on them to inspect and filter the data.

### Section 2: Data Wrangling
To prepare our data for analysis, we need to perform data wrangling. In this section, we will learn how to clean and reformat data (e.g., renaming columns and fixing data type mismatches), restructure/reshape it, and enrich it (e.g., discretizing columns, calculating aggregations, and combining data sources).

### Section 3: Data Visualization
The human brain excels at finding patterns in visual representations of the data; so in this section, we will learn how to visualize data using pandas along with the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for additional features. We will create a variety of visualizations that will help us better understand our data.

### Section 4: Hands-On Data Analysis Lab
We will practice all that you’ve learned in a hands-on lab. This section features a set of analysis tasks that provide opportunities to apply the material from the previous sections.

## Prerequisites
You should have basic knowledge of Python and be comfortable working in Jupyter Notebooks. Check out [this notebook](https://github.com/stefmolin/Hands-On-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas-2nd-edition/blob/master/ch_01/python_101.ipynb) for a crash course in Python or work through the [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) for a more formal introduction. The environment we will use for this workshop comes with JupyterLab, which is pretty intuitive, but be sure to familiarize yourself [using notebooks in JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/notebook.html) and [additional functionality in JupyterLab](https://dzone.com/articles/getting-started-with-jupyterlab).

## Setup Instructions

Pick the installation option that makes sense for you:

- [Local Installation](#local-installation)
- [Docker Container](#docker-installation)
- [Cloud Service](#cloud-options)

### Local Installation
**Warning**: It is highly recommended that you use your personal laptop for the installation.

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), if not already installed on your computer.

2. Fork this repository:

    ![location of fork button in GitHub](./media/fork_button.png)

3. Navigate to your fork, and click the **Code** button:

    ![location of code button in GitHub](./media/code_button.png)

4. Clone your forked repository using the desired method from the **Local** tab:

    <img width="400px" src="./media/clone_options.png" alt="local cloning options">

5. Install one of the following, if not already installed:
    - [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (recommended)
    - Python >= version 3.10 and <= version 3.13 via [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)/[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Note that Anaconda/Miniconda is recommended if you are working on a Windows machine and are not very comfortable with the command line.

6. Set up your environment and launch JupyterLab:
    - Using `uv`:

        ```shell
        $ cd pandas-workshop
        $ uv run jupyter lab
        ```

    - If you installed Anaconda/Miniconda, use `conda` (on Windows, these commands should be run in **Anaconda Prompt**):

        ```shell
        $ cd pandas-workshop
        $ conda env create --file environment.yml
        $ conda activate pandas_workshop
        (pandas_workshop) $ jupyter lab
        ```

    - Otherwise, use `venv`:

        ```shell
        $ cd pandas-workshop
        $ python3 -m venv pandas_workshop
        $ source pandas_workshop/bin/activate
        (pandas_workshop) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        (pandas_workshop) $ jupyter lab
        ```

7. Navigate to the `0-check_your_env.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks/` folder:

    ![open 0-check_your_env.ipynb](./media/open_env_check_notebook.png)

### Cloud Options

#### GitHub Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/stefmolin/pandas-workshop)

The [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) setup provides a pre-configured machine accessible via your browser. You will need a GitHub account and available quota (all users get more than enough free monthly quota to be able to run this workshop). Note that this will take a while to build. It's recommended that you click the badge above to build the codespace in advance of the workshop and then [stop the codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/stopping-and-starting-a-codespace) until the workshop, at which point you can simply resume and pick up where you left off.

Note that if you want to save your changes, you will need to fork the repository before creating the codespace. You will then be able to commit your changes directly from the codespace. Be sure to create your codespace in advance of the session and resume when we start.

1. Fork this repository:

    ![location of fork button in GitHub](./media/fork_button.png)

2. Navigate to your fork, and click the **Code** button:

    ![location of code button in GitHub](./media/code_button.png)

3. Launch the codespace from your fork by clicking on the **+** or **Create codespace on main** button in the **Codespaces** tab:

    <img width="400px" src="./media/create_codespace.png" alt="location of create codespace button">

4. Stop the codespace until the session starts by selecting **Stop codespace** from the **...** menu.

    <img width="400px" src="./media/stop-codespace.png" alt="stop codespace">

5. To resume the codespace, click **Open in ...** and then select your preferred method. If you aren't sure, select JupyterLab.

    <img width="400px" src="./media/resume-codespace.png" alt="resuming a codespace">

#### Binder

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/stefmolin/pandas-workshop/main?urlpath=lab/tree/notebooks)

Depending on server availability, you can use [this](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/stefmolin/pandas-workshop/main?urlpath=lab) Binder environment, which does not require the creation of a GitHub account. **There is no guarantee that you will be able to access this during the workshop.**
